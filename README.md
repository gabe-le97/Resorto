# Resorto

A fully-functional website with responsive design, data persistence, 
and user authentication made possible with Bootstrap, MongoDB, Express, Node.js, and other backend packages.

Resorto is a project that I worked on while taking an online full-stack developer class by Colt Steele. 
It is based off his project Yelpcamp and features the same technologies that he used.  

>Always a possibility of adding new features

This project is currently up and running [here](https://resorto.herokuapp.com/). It is hosted on Heroku's servers and uses mLab as the database host.
